### 📝 Platform-Specific Notes

**Android:**
- Ensure ADB is properly configured and your device is connected (you can also use emulation)
- SDK 34 is required
- Release builds require signing (see [NoCrypt's signing guide](https://github.com/NoCrypt/sign-android))

**Windows:**
- Docker requires WSL to be installed and configured
- Use the Windows-specific native build command

> [!NOTE]
> **Credit:** Special thanks to [NoCrypt](https://github.com/NoCrypt) for the initial Android build setup!
